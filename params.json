{"name":"Quickhash GUI","tagline":"Fast, cross-platform, graphical data hashing tool for Linux, Windows and Mac","body":"### Welcome to the official QuickHash GitHub Page.\r\n\r\nQuickHash is software for Linux, Windows, and Apple Mac GUI that enables rapid selection & hashing of files (individually or recursively), text and physical disks. Designed for Linux, but also available for Windows and to an experimental degree,  Apple Mac. MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512 available. CSV\\HTML\\Clipboard output. \r\n\r\nA source directory can be hashed, then copied & reconstructed to a destination folder where the content is then hashed again for verification. \r\n\r\nSelected file masks are available (*.doc; *.xls etc). \r\n\r\nSince v.2.4.0 Windows users are able to hash physical disks (SHA-1 only).\r\n\r\nLINUX USERS NOTE : The Linux zip contains both 64 & 32 bit versions. Use the correct one for your system - 32 bit won't work on 64 bit OS and visa versa. \r\n\r\nAPPLE MAC USERS : v2.5.3 = first Apple Mac release. Totally experimental. Will abandon if proves too hard to stablise. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\nRecursive hashing, or hashing and copying to reconstructed directory directory and re-hashing in destination directory.\r\nAbility to hash physical disks in Windows and both physcial & logical disks if run in Linux (using root or sudo), e.g. /dev/hda or /dev/hda1\r\nSimple recursive hashing of all files in a selected directory and its sub-directories\r\nMD5/SHA1/SHA256/SHA512 algorithms available\r\nDrag and Drop available for individual files\r\nDesigned as a GUI for Linux but also compiled for Windows and Apple Mac\r\nEnables digital forensic practitioners or IT security staff to hash files at times when files have been extracted out from forensic software before or after transportation to non-forensic staff\r\nA simple interface, suitable for non-technical users.\r\nUsually faster than mainstream hashing Windows tools\r\nResults can be exported to CSV text file, or a HTML web file, or clipboard or all\r\nASCII and Unicode aware on both Windows (as of v2.3) and Linux (as of always)\r\nFull PDF manual with screenshots and explanation of all features.\r\nNo installation. No wizards. No registration. Just double click and use, instantly.\r\nOpen Source (please feedback any code improvements for future versions)\r\n\r\n### Download \r\n\r\nBinaries for all platforms are available, for now, from the Sourceforge page. In the future, it is the intention to work out a way to host them via Github too. \r\n\r\n[http://sourceforge.net/projects/quickhash/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/quickhash/)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@tedsmith.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nRaise tickets via the Sourceforge page : [http://sourceforge.net/p/quickhash/feature-requests](http://sourceforge.net/p/quickhash/feature-requests)","google":"pub-8309460918831894","note":"Don't delete this file!

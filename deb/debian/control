Description: Graphical data hashing tool
 QuickHash is a graphical means for users to easily
 hash data such as text, files, or even disks using Linux
 without knowing command line syntax.

 It can also be used for copying files from one folder to another
 where hashes are computed prior to copying and afterwards.
 .
 Users can compare to files, or compare two folders, using hash
 anaysis to be sure one matches the other

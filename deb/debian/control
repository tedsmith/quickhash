Description: Graphical data hashing tool
 QuickHash is a graphical means for users to easily
 hash data such as text, files, or even disks using Linux
 without knowing command line syntax. 
 .
 It can also be used for copying files from one folder to another
 where hashes are computed prior to copying and afterwards.
 .
 Users can compare to files, or compare two folders, using hash
 anaysis to be sure one matches the other
